# [Questions](https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/06-Week_6_discussion_questions/index.html)

1. Hypothes.is
Please write at least one comment or reply to a comment on each module. Wherever possible, try to connect content to material covered in the book (page numbers are be great if you can find them!). Other comments might include questions, identification of key points, or thoughts on how learners might interpret (or misinterpret) certain content.



2. [Memory and cognitive load](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory/index.html)
This episode provides reasons why we go slowly and allow time for practice. However, instructors are often faced with the urge to go faster or ‘get through’ everything. How can we help instructors remember to keep it slow and resist the urge to solve timing problems by talking faster?
	- There's no point rushing through the material if learners don't understand: far better to cover less and have learners understand everything.
	- We can also set realistic timings for the lessons. Most of them have hopelessly optimistic timings for novices. which creates this urge to 'get through' the material. As a start, instructor guides for the lessons could suggest which combinations of episodes to teach, but really, a minimum sub-set should form the core of the lessons, with extra material available if you have a quick group, or are teaching outside of a workshop.

3. The concept mapping example has been criticized for inducing extraneous cognitive load. Can you construct an alternative example that is more accessible to novices? Bonus points if it still has some relevance to our curriculum!
	- List all the concepts instead of drawing a diagram.
	- Improve the labelling of the example concept map so concept maps are easier to understand.
	- Alternative example: how to make a cup of tea

4. Non-programming learners who are taking Instructor Training are often directed to study the OpenRefine lesson. What could you direct these learners to do during the section on faded examples?
	- Think about what the key steps are for an OpenRefine task, and how they could create an instruction set with key steps missing.

5. [Building skill with feedback](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback/index.html)
 We generally do a good job of modeling the collection of feedback in an instructor training workshop. How can we also model good use of feedback in this context?
 	- By responding to it after lunch. Maybe add a short episode as a reminder.
 
 6. [Motivation and Demotivation](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/index.html)
  Avoiding demotivating learners is at least as important as motivating them, but there are lots of things an instructor could do to accidentally demotivate learners. What strategies can we give our instructors for recovering from these slip-ups?
  	- Apologize and recognise the demotivating behaviour
  	- Explain that everything is difficult until you know how to do it, recounting an anecdote of something similar that you used to find difficult but can now do. "Errors are how you learn".

7. This section is currently too long, and you will likely need to skip the section on “stereotype threat.” How would you summarize the main point of this section for your learners before moving on?
	- Be fair (treat everyone the same)

8. [Mindset](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/09-mindset/index.html)
How might the concepts taught in this lesson apply to the process of learning to becoming a better teacher?
	- Growth mindset will help you become a better teacher: viewing errors as a learning opportunity, combined with feedback are how you'll improve next time
	- Praise in your learners what you want to encourage (effort and grit, because these reinforce the growth mindset) --- in the same way, you should focus on your improvement in teaching ability, working on your weaknesses.
