# Reading summary
## Chapter 6: Why do student development and course climate matter for learning?
Students may be immature in some regards but mature in others. 
Ideas which challenge their sense of identity may be heavily resisted and block their ability to learn.
Shades of grey and multiple valid opinions can be difficult for less mature learners to deal with.
Instructors' expectation should be realistic for the level of development of their learners.

Course climate is important because it is easy to demotivate a learner, and it's difficult to recover from.
As such, *be fair* --- treating students differently is demotivating even if you're trying to be nice.

Climate works in both blatant and subtle ways, and is as much about what you leave out as what you include. As an instructor, you have a  lot of control over the climate --- make it an encouraging and welcoming one, because this offers the best learning outcomes.

### Recommendations
- Make uncertainty safe: part of critical thinking is to embrace complexity
- Resist a single right answer, and ask for their perspective before giving yours to avoid biasing them
- Examine your assumptions about students. They affect how we interact with students, which impacts their learning. Students may not share your background and frames of reference, which can be alienating.
- Model inclusive language and behaviour, so that no-one feels marginalized
- Use diverse examples, so that everyone relates to something. Better still, chose examples that work across cultures, appeal to both sexes etc
- Establish and enforce ground rules for interaction
- Address tensions early

## Chapter 7: How do students become self-directed learners?
Metacognition is the process of reflecting on and directing one's own thinking.
To become self-directed, students must be able to assess the demands of the task, evaluate their own knowledge and skills, plan their approach and *monitor their progress and adjust their strategies as needed*.
Metacognition usually isn't taught in courses, but would benefit students greatly.

Megacognition steps:
- assesssing the task in hand --- isn't always easy even when descriptive instructions are given
- evaluating one's own strength's and weaknesses --- this is something most people but especially novices are really bad at
- planning an appropriate approach --- both sufficient and appropriate to the task
- applying strategies and monitoring learning performance --- is the current strategy working?
- adjusting the approach --- learners may not know how to adjust their approach even if they've identified that the current one isn't working

Metacognition requires a growth mindset where the learner believes that they can improve their skills through practice.

### Recommendations
#### Assessing the task
- Be more explicit than you may think is necessary
- Tell students what you don't want
- Provide performance criteria

#### Evaluating one's own strengths and weaknesses
- Give early, performance-based assessments
- Provide opportunities for self-assessment

#### Planning an appropriate approach
- Have students implement a plan you provide
- Have students create their own plan
- Make planning the central goal of the assignment

#### Applying strategies and monitoring performance
- Provide heuristics for self-correction --- is the answer reasonable?
- Get students to mark their own work using a mark scheme
- Use peer review --- provides feedback and enables students to better monitor their own work

#### Reflecting on and adjusting one's approach
- Provide activities where students have to reflect on their performance
- Present mutliple strategies
- Create assignments which focus on strategizing rather than implementation

#### Beliefs about intelligence and learning
- Address beliefs about leanring directly --- ability is driven by practice, effort and adaptation, not innate ability
- Set realistic expectations about how long developing particular skills might take

#### Generally
- Model your metacognitive processes --- walk though how you would approach an assignment
- Scaffold students in their megacognitive processes, to develop discrete phases

# Questions
1. What stood out to you from this week’s reading?
	- It could be very easy to unintentionally demotivate students, through use of language, cultural references, and your own assumptions.

2. While this chapter views “culture” through a developmental lens, most of the topics covered here also relate to adults. How might these factors relate to:
	1. the Code of Conduct
		- Establish ground rules for interaction
		- Model inclusive language
	2. Motivation (try to be specific!)
		- Don't marginalize students with content which excludes certain demographics, cultural references, language
	3. Cognition & memory
		- Um ...

3. Which of the strategies suggested on pages 180-186 are most applicable to Carpentries workshops? In what ways might new instructors need support or guidance in implementing these?
	- Set ground rules for interaction (code of conduct)
	- Model inclusive language
	- Resist a single right answer
	- Ensure course content is not marginalizing
	- Be aware of low-ability cues

4. Most of our learners have experience with metacognitive strategies, but may not automatically apply them to the content of our workshops (content or Instructor Training). Why do you think this is? How can we support our learners in transferring these skills appropriately?

5. Please have some plain paper and a dark-colored marker handy during discussion in case we get to work on this question. Try making a concept map that outlines ways in which metacognition is (or can be) supported during a workshop, referencing one or more of the strategies listed on p.203-215. What did you learn from this process?
