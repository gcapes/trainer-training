# Chapter 3 notes
Motivation is the personal investment an individual has in reaching a desired outcome or state.
Interest/relevance is strongly tied to motivation, as is whether there is an expectation of success - people are motivated to learn only when they expect to be able to achieve something.
Motivation is based on a *subjective* value of the goal, and the expectation of success.
Value types
- attainment (mastering a task)
- intrinsic (enjoy doing the task)
- instrumental (to achieve other goals)
Expectancy types
- outcome (specific actions result in desired outcome)
- efficacy (able to do the work required to achieve outcome)
More likely to expect success from controllable causes (ability/effort).
Motivation highest when student attribute success to ability/effort, and poor performance 
to lack of effort/information:
this leads to the expectation that high performance can be sustained, and poor performance improved.
A supportive environment enhances motivation.

To establish value
- link material to students' interest
- use authentic tasks
- show relevance for future lives
- be enthusiastic

To build positive expectancies
- appropriate level of challenge
- provide early success opportunities
- be fair

# [Week 2 questions](https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/02_week2_discussion_questions/index.html)
1. Motivation as the key driver of learning. New knowledge is always built on existing knowledge.
2. Expert blindspot - hope to cover more material than is possible.
3. Learner mental model of someone who has just taken a Carpentries workshop - Panel A: splodges of knowledge but connections only between some of the concepts.
4. Carpentries instructors can help learners organise their knowledge by highlighting links between concepts, and referring back to earlier material. This should be easy enough for a new instructor to implement.
5. Responses to pre-assessment survey might enable you to tailor the course to what the learners know. Spend more time on something that most people don't already know, and move quickly over things that people can already do.
Extra question: what's your familiarity with Git? This indicates the person's ability to contribute to lesson materials.
6. Concept map for motivation:
motivation is the key driver of desired learning outcome
support from the environment, positive expectancies, and value in the goal provide the motivation
7. Learning is most likely to be successful if there is motivation, expectation of success, and a supportive environment. The value of a goal is subjective, but can be influenced by your enthusiasm and choice of relevant, authentic tasks.
8. The intended audience at Carpentries workshops will primarily have performance goals: they're researchers who want to be more productive, and see programming as a 'tax' required to achieve that goal.
At instructor training workshops, learners will primarily have learning goals: they're volunteers, who want to better understand how learning works in order to teach that to instructors.
9. Establish value by using authentic tasks: this addresses the instrumental value researchers might typically associate with programming (they get their results more quickly).
Rubrics not that relevant to Carpentries workshops, because there is no assessment.
