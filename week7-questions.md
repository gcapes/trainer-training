# [Questions](https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/07-Week_7_discussion_questions/index.html)
1. Hypothes.is (optional comments on material)
2. [Teaching is a skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/11-practice-teaching/index.html)
The majority of this lesson consists of practice and feedback in various ways. Apart from those experiences, can you identify two key points that you would like to get across to learners during this lesson?
	1. The process of learning to teach is the same as learning anything else: practice and feedback
	2. Never teach alone
		- Observing other trainers enables you to incorporate their good ideas into your own teaching
		- Get feedback on your teacing from other instructors
		- Use them as a feedback translator
	3. Initiate feedback, and ask specific questions so that it's useful:
	   feedback should be one-up, one-down for both content and delivery
3. [Live coding is a skill](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-live/index.html)
How does practice of participatory live coding relate to concepts we have learned about cognition, memory, and motivation?
	- Cognition:
		- Regular practice (typing) and feedback (error messages)
		- Forces slower pace than slides (limits cognitive overload)
	- Memory:
		- split memory affect makes it hard to type and listen to instructor
	- Motivation:
		- More compelling to see a program being written than presenting a finished product
		- See instructor make mistakes, so learn how to debug
		- Easier to respond to learners' questions (interests)
4. [Preparing to teach](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-lesson-study/index.html)
Identify one concept from this lesson that you think might be challenging to communicate. Compose a short sentence to explain that concept (or some part of it) in your own words.
	- Didn't manage to identify anything. Lesson seems well explained already.
5. [Managing a diverse classroom](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/18-management/index.html)
Most people never feel fully confident about their ability to manage a potential Code of Conduct violation. It is important that instructors have at least enough confidence in our process that they feel empowered to act and report if an incident occurs. Helping learners to gain this confidence begins with building on your own! How confident do you feel that you could manage an incident at a workshop? What questions do you have? What fears or doubts?
	- Should a code of conduction violation be addressed publically, or privately?
	- Just having a code of conduct and making everyone aware of it probably makes a deliberate violation of it unlikely.
	- If a learner feels that the code of conduct has been broken, what should they do about it?
	- If the instructor breaks the code of conduct, how should a learner handle the situation?
6. [Workshop introductions](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/23-introductions/index.html)
This section includes a LOT of things that can be included in a good introduction. It is probably a good idea to give our instructors some guidance on where to begin. How would you distill this message in a recap or summary of this lesson? What are the most important elements to convey?
	- Focus on the goals of the introduction. Learners should:
		- have confidence in your ability to teach the workshop
		- expect to receive instruction via live coding
		- be clear about the learning objectives
		- know what is expected of them (code of conduct, sticky notes, feedback)
