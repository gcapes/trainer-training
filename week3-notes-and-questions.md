# Reading summary
## Chapter 4: Developing mastery
Students may have components skills that they are unable to apply and combine in a new situation --- they don't recognise what is required.

Mastery requires component skills, ability to combine them, and knowledge of when to apply them.
Mastery is unconscious competence --- when you don't even think about what you're doing e.g. driving.
Expert blindspot results from chunking knowledge, from taking unconscious shortcuts, and results in underestimating the difficulty of a task for a novice.
Instructors should therefore decompose complex tasks into component parts.

*Cognitive overload* may explain why novices perform badly at complex tasks even if they have the component skills.
*Scaffolding* such as worked-examples can lighten the cognitive load so that students may learn e.g. problem solving techniques rather than focussing on the individual steps.
However, care should be taken what cognitive load is removed. Extraneous load can be removed, but providing scaffolding for those concepts being practiced is obviously counterproductive.

Students sometimes fail to *transfer* their knowledge to new situations.

### Recommendations
To expose and reinforce component skill
- review (or get someone without your expert blindspot to review) the material to identify if all steps have been decomposed
- explicitly state your learning objectives and key aspects of a task. This helps to reduce cognitive load and distractions by extraneous features of a task.
- give a diagnostic exam early on, and provide isolate practice for weak skills.

To facilitate transfer
- give opportunities to apply skills in diverse contexts
- compare scenarios to identify deep features
- provide prompts to relevant knowledge

To build fluency
- practice with the aim of building efficiency
- constrain scope of the problem before recombining (e.g. right hand and left hand parts)

## Appendix D: What are learning objectives and how can we use them?
Learning objectives articulate the knowledge and skills you want students to acquire.
They help students to better direct their learning efforts.
They help you to design your lesson material and assessments.

Learning objectives should:

- be student-focussed "students should be able to X"
- break down the task into specific cognitive processes
- use action verbs (to reduce ambiguity of learning objective) vs 'understand X'. Bloom's taxonomy uses these categories:
	1. remember
	1. understand
	1. apply
	1. analyze
	1. evaluate
	1. create
- be measurable so we can assess whether the objectives have been met

## Chapter 5: What kinds of practice and feedback enhance learning?
### Goal-directed practice
Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback are critical to learning.

Giving feedback is of little use if students have no opportunity to incorporate the feedback into further practice.
Practising without goals doesn't tend to result in improved performance
Practising without goals doesn't tend to result in improved performance.

The goals/learning objectives should be specific, and *understandable by the students*. This latter point is a key challenge in setting goal-directed practice tasks. Only when students understand exactly what the goals are, can they know what to practice --- sharing the marking scheme can give a lot of clarity here.

Goals provide a focus for learning, and can be used to monitor one's progress (adjusting the practice accordingly). This is called *deliberate practice* i.e. working towards a goal, and focussing on your weaknesses.

An appropriate level of challenge is vital for an exercise to be useful: too hard and it's demotivating; too easy and the student isn't learning anything. It should be achieveable but challenging. 

Scaffolding can help achieve a suitable level of difficulty, and help maintain motivation where a student might otherwise struggle and give up due to a negative expectation of success.

It isn't always obvious to learners whether their practice has actually led to improved performance.

#### Recommendations
- Conduct a prior knoweldge assessment
- Be explicit about your goals in course materials
- Share the mark scheme
- Give multiple opportunities for practice
- Build scaffolding into assignments, then remove over time (e.g. set discrete challenges then one which combines the individual steps)

### Feedback
Feedback should tell learners what they understand, what they are performing well at, and how they should direct future efforts. It should be given at a time when it can inform learners' subsequent learning (*formative feedback*).

Be careful not to give too much feedback --- focus instead on the most important aspects.

In general, the earlier feedback is given the better, and the more frequently the better. However, feedback too early denies students the opportunity to recognise and fix their own mistakes.

#### Recommendations
- Look for patterns of errors
- Prioritize feedback to avoid overwhelming, and enable targetted practice
- Give positive and negative feedback
- Multiple exercises give multiple opportunities for feedback and hence targetted practice
- Provide group feedback
- Incorporate peer feedback --- reduces your load, helps students identify qualities of good work

# [Questions](https://carpentries.github.io/trainer-training/03_week3_discussion_questions/index.html)
1. What stood out from this week's reading?

2.  
	1. How might we effectively manage expert blind spots and cognitive load when teaching instructor training workshops?
		- draw concept maps to highlight all the concepts involved, and teach all the steps rather than taking any shortcuts
		- stop for an exercise when working memory is full -- transfer to long-term memory
	1.  Are there any specific ways in which you think Trainer expertise or cognitive overload pose a particular risk during an instructor training event?
		- There's too much material for the time, so it will be tempting to move too quickly resulting in cognitive overload
3. 
	1. When students learn skills but don’t learn how to apply them, they may fail to use those skills when they are relevant. How do we help learners bridge the gap between learning and application? In other words, how do we “teach to facilitate transfer”?
		- use exercises to apply the learning from code-along examples
	1. Is this different for instructor training vs other Carpentries workshops?
		- Um ...
4.  Use the chart on p. 246 to examine some learning objectives from Carpentries workshops (computational and/or instructor training). In what categories of Bloom’s Taxonomy do these fall? Do they seem appropriate to the level of the learners? Do they seem sufficient, as workshop outcomes?
	- Categories (from Shell lesson): understand, apply, create
	- I think that they're at an appropriate level and sufficient as learning outcomes.
5. 
	1. Chapter 5 discusses the importance of setting good opportunities for practice. How does this apply in a workshop setting? 
		- Having enough exercises at an appropriate level
		- Being clear what concepts are being tested
	1. What role does/can an instructor play in this regard? A helper?
		- Instructors and helpers can explain misconceptions
1. 
	1. Feedback is an essential component of effective practice. In what ways do learners in a computational workshop get feedback on their progress?
		- Solutions to exercises
		- Error messages / unwanted results vs expected results
		- Red sticky notes
	1. How does that feedback meet (or not) the criteria for useful feedback outlined in this chapter?
		- Early --- don't have to wait for feedback until the end of the course
		- Sometimes formative feedback (depends on whether the next exercise uses the same concepts). Sometimes there is no opportunity to practice with that feedback in mind because we don't tend to repeat similar exercises.
1. 
	1. How do you expect practice and feedback to contribute to your skill development as a Trainer? 
		- I will improve with practice and feedback
	1. What will you need to do to facilitate this? What can the Carpentries do to support this?
		- Request feedback from learners and other instructors
		- Carpentries can share responses to feedback forms
