2. What questions do you have about your role as a Trainer or your participation in the Trainer community?
	-
3. How Learning Works --- Conclusion
What advice might you give to instructors to help them “play to their own strengths and weaknesses”?
	- Teaching is a skill that can be learnt and refined
	- Work on improving one thing at a time
	- Seek out and pay attention to feedback

4. [Checkout Process](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/20-checkout/index.html)
Instructor checkout can be intimidating and confusing. We’re working to improve that! In the mean time, what can a trainer do to help encourage instructors to complete the checkout process?
	- Emphasise that this is an achievable process
	- There are benefits of completing the process such as being able to lead a workshop

5. [The Carpentries: How We Operate](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/21-carpentries/index.html)
Do you have any questions about policies and procedures for running a workshop? What do you think might be unclear to instructors reading these materials?
	- Lesson says carpentries lesson programs are domain-specific, but SWC aren't. [Issue](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues/906)
	- Why there is a form for a self-organised workshop *and* a request to email the coordinator after you've completed the form
	- Separate links for SWC workshop, 2 links for data carpentry workshop, but no links for library carpentry workshops. But there's one form for all of them.

6. [Putting It Together](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/24-practices/index.html)
Try the “Organize your knowledge” activity! Report back: what did you learn?
	- Concept maps and knowledge organisation into a framework are difficult!
	- The lack of absolutely right/wrong answers makes it even more difficult
	- Nonetheless, the process forces you to think about the links between ideas
