1. Comments, questions or replies?
	- Formative assessment is a great idea, but can we have an actual example from Software Carpentry? How can we actually use a formative assessment to adapt what we teach depending on the assessment results?
		- Formative assessments should be used to check understanding of what has just been taught, rather than to check whether you can skip over some material (which is the purpose of a pre-assessment).
	- Getting feedback from learners is difficult
2. What stands out?
	- Teaching is a skill that requires practice and feedback
	- SWC aim is to build a correct mental model: teaching how to think about a topic more so than the details of specific programming skills
	- The need to go slowly to avoid completely demotivating a learner
	- Instructors need feedback on learners' progress to be effective
3. Assessing trainee's backgrounds (familiarity with SWC workshops, and their teaching experience).
	1. How might you use them to adjust your instruction in the subsequent modules?
		- If your learners are already familiar with SWC you might be able to move faster through that section
		- You might be able to incorporate examples and anecdotes relevant to participants' experience
	2. Can you think of a (quick, multiple choice) alternative or additional question that you would like to ask?
		- Um ...
4. It can be useful to prepare personal examples for some topics. Identify one thing each that you’re a novice for, a competent practitioner for and an expert at. How would you explain the way you have categorized these skills?
	- Novice with R: I can help out at a workshop but don't *know* the syntax or how to do anything not already in the notes
	- Competant practitioner with Python: I can write functions and script to do normal tasks but often look up how to do things. My mental model of MATLAB is better and I'm only starting to 'think' in Python.
	- Expert with Git: I have a good conceptual understanding of how it works, I'm confident with more advanced features like rebasing, can help people recover from messed up states, and I'm experienced with best practices for collaboration.
5. Try creating a concept map that relates the following 3 concepts: skill acquisition, mental models, formative assessment
	- formative assessment identifies the quality of the mental model
	- formative assessment informs required areas of skill acquisition
	- skill acquisition builds and improves mental models
	- mental models are required for skill aquisition because facts need to be attached to something
6.  We introduce skill acquisition in this module, but really dig into expertise in the next. What is the purpose of introducing skill acquisition here? What should be emphasized here, vs in the next section?
	- Skill acquisition relates to mental models - it gives context for what is meant by a novice and what change we're looking to achieve with the learners who attend a workshop (turning them into competant practitioners)
	- Emphasise here: novices don't know what they don't know --- we're aiming to help them build correct mental models
	- Emphasise in expertise episode: expert blindspot. A therefore E misses the intermediate steps which novices need explaining
7. Dismissive language can occur as a result of negligence, but it can also happen as a result of good intentions. Trainees are often surprised to be told that telling learners that a task is “easy” is dismissive. How would you help someone who wants to convey to learners that a task is achievable to find a way to convey that message in a more motivating way?
	- Say something is achieveable rather than easy.
	- "Give this a try" ...
	- Encourage people to work together
